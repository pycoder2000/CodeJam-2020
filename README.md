# Solutions to problems of Code Jam 2020

This repository includes my solutions to the problems of the Google Code Jam
competitions year 2020, either as submitted during the contest or made on a second thought.

The sources are in Python and C++.
Unless otherwise noted, everything is judged as correct, either in contest or under practice mode.

VS Code is still my favorite IDE.

## Code Jam 2020

* Qualification round:
    * **Vestigium**, trivial O(n*n) solution scanning rows and columns for duplicates
    * **Nesting Depth**, linear solution comparing the current depth with the next digit
    * **Parenting Partnering Returns**, O(n log n) solution performing a linear scan on sorted activities
    * **ESAb ATAd**: very fun interactive problem, solved by querying two specular bits
                     every 10 queries to detect the kind of "quantum fluctuation".
